## **What problems it resolves?**

Nowadays there are emerging many new assets in the WEB3 world, such as **NFTs, LP tokens, yield-bearing tokens,** bringing a large number of new users, especially enthusiasts of NFTs. However, there are still **not enough usage scenarios** for these assets, **users holding them but don’t know how to use them, how to earn from them**.

This is a good market opportunity. Palm Finance is designed to resolve this problem and improve the capital utilization efficiency of those innovative assets.

**On Palm Finance, users can:**

- Deposit assets portfolio (NFTs, LPs, yield-bearing coins) as collateral, borrow stablecoin $PUST at 0% interest
- Leverage their position, multiply farming yields up to 11x
- Stake & earn platform rewards
- Liquidity mining with Call Options



## **Highlights and Features**

1.Accepting NFTs,LP tokens, interest-bearing tokens as collaterals

2.Borrowing against the assets portfolio instead of single assetsYou can deposit all your assets in one port-folio, instead of opening a position for each asset, the collateral diversity of in your protfolio reduces the risk of liquidation.

3.Maximizing capital efficiency -The lowest collateral ratio (110%) required on Palm allows users to obtain up to 11x 

4.Borrowing at 0% interest

5.Proving a new liquidity mining model with call options



## **Project Progress:**

After 3 months of development, we’ve completed 80% of the Dapp, System is already in testing and the main functions can be used.

The section of depositing NFT is in developing and coming soon.
